# Compatible Soldering Irons for Custom Controller

Based on the specifications of our custom soldering iron controller, the following soldering irons should be compatible and work well out of the box:

1. **Hakko FX-8801 Soldering Iron**
   - Operating Voltage: 24V
   - Power Consumption: 65W
   - Temperature Range: 200°C to 480°C
   - Features a ceramic heating element and uses T18 series tips
   - Reason for Compatibility: Matches our 24V power supply requirement and falls within our temperature control range.

2. **KSGER T12 Soldering Iron Handle**
   - Operating Voltage: 24V
   - Power Consumption: 72W
   - Compatible with T12 series tips
   - Reason for Compatibility: Designed for DIY stations, works with 24V, and is easily controllable via PWM.

3. **JBC C245 Soldering Iron**
   - Operating Voltage: 24V
   - Power Consumption: 50W
   - Temperature Range: 90°C to 450°C
   - Uses C245 series cartridge tips
   - Reason for Compatibility: Matches voltage requirements and has a suitable temperature range.

4. **Weller WSP 80 Soldering Iron**
   - Operating Voltage: 24V
   - Power Consumption: 80W
   - Temperature Range: 50°C to 450°C
   - Uses WS80 and LT series tips
   - Reason for Compatibility: Operates at 24V and has a wide temperature range that our controller can handle.

5. **Quick 957D-24V-60W Soldering Iron Handle**
   - Operating Voltage: 24V
   - Power Consumption: 60W
   - Compatible with 900M series tips
   - Reason for Compatibility: Specifically designed for 24V operation and easily controllable.

When selecting a soldering iron, consider the following:

- Ensure the iron operates at 24V to match our power supply.
- Check that its power consumption doesn't exceed what our MOSFET (IRLZ44N) can handle.
- Verify that its temperature sensor (usually a thermocouple) is compatible with our LM358P-based sensing circuit.
- Consider the availability and cost of replacement tips.

Remember to always refer to the manufacturer's specifications and consult with them if you're unsure about compatibility. Some minor adjustments to the controller's code or calibration might be necessary for optimal performance with different irons.
